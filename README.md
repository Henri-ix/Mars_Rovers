# Mars Rovers
A Mars rover application that simulates remote control of multiple rovers

Start off by inputting the plateau size using x y coordinates in the format "X Y", note these coordinates must be bigger than 1

Then input the details of the rover such as x y and its cardinal point, please put in the right coordinates as if you make a rover, and it's already out of bounds you won't be able to move it.

Follow the terminal prompts to quit

Enjoy!
